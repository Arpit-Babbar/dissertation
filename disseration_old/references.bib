abstract = {The main result in this paper is a provably entropy stable shock capturing approach for the high order entropy stable Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM) based on a hybrid blending with a subcell low order variant. Since it is possible to rewrite a high order summation-by-parts (SBP) operator into an equivalent conservative finite volume form, we were able to design a low order scheme directly with the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes that is compatible to the discrete entropy analysis used for the proof of the entropy stable DGSEM. Furthermore, we present a hybrid low order/high order discretisation where it is possible to seamlessly blend between the two approaches, while still being provably entropy stable. With tensor products and careful design of the low order scheme on curved elements, we are able to extend the approach to three spatial dimensions on unstructured curvilinear hexahedral meshes. We validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate convergence order for smooth problems, conservation of the primary quantities and discrete entropy stability for an arbitrary blending on curvilinear grids. In practical simulations, we connect the blending factor to a local troubled element indicator that provides the control of the amount of low order dissipation injected into the high order scheme. We modified an existing shock indicator, which is based on the modal polynomial representation, to our provably stable hybrid scheme. The aim is to reduce the impact of the parameters as good as possible. We describe our indicator in detail and demonstrate its robustness in combination with the hybrid scheme, as it is possible to compute all the different test cases without changing the indicator. The test cases include e.g. the double Mach reflection setup, forward and backward facing steps with shock Mach numbers up to 100. The proposed approach is relatively straight forward to implement in an existing entropy stable DGSEM code as only modifications local to an element are necessary.}

                   solutions such as shockwaves (discontinuities in conserved
                   variables), rarefaction waves (discontinuities in
                   derivatives), and vacuum states (loss of strong
                   hyperbolicity). When ostensibly high-order numerical methods
                   are applied in such solution regimes, unphysical
                   oscillations present themselves that can lead to large
                   errors and a breakdown of the numerical simulation. In this
                   work we develop a new Lax-Wendroff discontinuous Galerkin
                   (LxW-DG) method with a limiting strategy that keeps the
                   solution non-oscillatory and positivity-preserving for
                   relevant variables, such as height in the shallow water
                   equations and density and pressure in the compressible Euler
                   equations. The proposed LxW-DG scheme updates the solution
                   over each time-step with a locally-implicit predictor
                   followed by an explicit corrector. The locally-implicit
                   prediction phase is formulated in terms of primitive
                   variables, which greatly simplifies the solver. The
                   resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations are
                   approximately solved via a Picard iteration, where the
                   number of iterations is equal to the order of accuracy of
                   the method. The correction phase is an explicit evaluation
                   formulated in terms of conservative variables in order to
                   guarantee numerical conservation. In order to achieve full
                   positivity-preservation, limiting is required in both the
                   prediction and correction steps. The resulting scheme is
                   applied to several standard test cases for the shallow water

    abstract = "{Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code arepo, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.}",

It is therefore important to continuously advance the numerical methods implemented in current astrophysical codes, especially also in light of evolving computer technology, which favours certain computational approaches over others. Here we introduce the new adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code tenet, which employs a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for hydrodynamics. The Euler equations in this method are solved in a weak formulation with a polynomial basis by means of explicit Runge–Kutta time integration and Gauss–Legendre quadrature. This approach offers significant advantages over commonly employed second-order finite-volume (FV) solvers. In particular, the higher order capability renders it computationally more efficient, in the sense that the same precision can be obtained at significantly less computational cost. Also, the DG scheme inherently conserves angular momentum in regions where no limiting takes place, and it typically produces much smaller numerical diffusion and advection errors than an FV approach. A further advantage lies in a more natural handling of AMR refinement boundaries, where a fall-back to first order can be avoided. Finally, DG requires no wide stencils at high order, and offers an improved data locality and a focus on local computations, which is favourable for current and upcoming highly parallel supercomputers. We describe the formulation and implementation details of our new code, and demonstrate its performance and accuracy with a set of two- and three-dimensional test problems. The results confirm that DG schemes have a high potential for astrophysical applications.}",

abstract = {On modern hardware architectures, the performance of Flux Reconstruction (FR) methods can be limited by memory bandwidth. In a typical implementation, these methods are implemented as a chain of distinct kernels. Often, a dataset which has just been written in the main memory by a kernel is read back immediately by the next kernel. One way to avoid such a redundant expenditure of memory bandwidth is kernel fusion. However, on a practical level kernel fusion requires that the source for all kernels be available, thus preventing calls to certain third-party library functions. Moreover, it can add substantial complexity to a codebase. An alternative to full kernel fusion is cache blocking. But for this to be effective, CPU cache has to be meaningfully big. Historically, size of L1 and L2 caches prevented cache blocking for high-order CFD applications. However in recent years, size of L2 cache has grown from around 0.25 MiB to 1.25 MiB, and made it possible to apply cache blocking for high-order CFD codes. In this approach, kernels remain distinct, and are executed one after another on small chunks of data that can fit in the cache, as opposed to on full datasets. These chunks of data stay in the cache and whenever a kernel requests access to data that is already in the cache, memory bandwidth is conserved. In this study, a data structure that facilitates cache blocking is considered, and a range of kernel grouping configurations for an FR based Euler solver are examined. A theoretical study is conducted for hexahedral elements with no anti-aliasing at p=3 and p=4 in order to determine the predicted performance of a few kernel grouping configurations. Then, these candidates are implemented in the PyFR solver and the performance gains in practice are compared with the theoretical estimates that range between 2.05x and 2.50x. An inviscid Taylor-Green Vortex test case is used as a benchmark, and the most performant configuration leads to a speedup of approximately 2.81x in practice.}

abstract = {The Lax-Wendroff method is a single step method for evolving time dependent solutions governed by partial differential equations, in contrast to Runge-Kutta methods that need multiple stages per time step. We develop a flux reconstruction version of the method in combination with a Jacobian-free Lax-Wendroff procedure that is applicable to general hyperbolic conservation laws. The method is of collocation type, is quadrature free and can be cast in terms of matrix and vector operations. Special attention is paid to the construction of numerical flux, including for non-linear problems, resulting in higher CFL numbers than existing methods, which is shown through Fourier analysis and yielding uniform performance at all orders. Numerical results up to fifth order of accuracy for linear and non-linear problems are given to demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the method.}

abstract = {Provably stable flux reconstruction (FR) schemes are derived for partial differential equations cast in curvilinear coordinates. Specifically, energy stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) schemes are considered as they allow for design flexibility as well as stability proofs for the linear advection problem on affine elements. Additionally, the curvilinear metric split-form for a linear physical flux is examined as it enables the development of energy stability proofs. The first critical step proves, that in curvilinear coordinates, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) conservative and non-conservative forms are inherently different–even under exact integration and analytically exact metric terms. This analysis demonstrates that the split form is essential to developing provably stable DG schemes on curvilinear coordinates and motivates the construction of metric dependent ESFR correction functions in each element. Furthermore, the provably stable FR schemes differ from schemes in the literature that only apply the ESFR correction functions to surface terms or on the conservative form, and instead incorporate the ESFR correction functions on the full split form of the equations. It is demonstrated that the scheme is divergent when the correction functions are only used for surface reconstruction in curvilinear coordinates. We numerically verify the stability claims for our proposed FR split forms and compare them to ESFR schemes in the literature. Lastly, the newly proposed provably stable FR schemes are shown to obtain optimal orders of convergence. The scheme loses the orders of accuracy at the equivalent correction parameter value c as that of the one-dimensional ESFR scheme.}

abstract = {Abstract High order schemes have been investigated for quite a long time, and the flux reconstruction (FR) scheme proposed by Huynh recently attracts the attention of researchers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Building the framework that bridges discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and spectral difference (SD) schemes, FR recovers DG and SD conveniently with a careful selection of parameters. In this article, FR scheme is realized based on the framework of p4est, an open source adaptive mesh refinement library. The shock capturing ability of localized Laplacian artificial viscosity and in-cell piecewise integrated solution methods are compared. Curved boundary treatment for high order schemes is adopted. The performance of developed code is estimated in both one and two dimensions including curved boundary and shock cases, and some attractive results are obtained.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple, efficient, and high-order accurate sliding-mesh interface approach to the spectral difference (SD) method. We demonstrate the approach by solving the two-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations on quadrilateral grids. This approach is an extension of the straight mortar method originally designed for stationary domains [7], [8]. Our sliding method creates curved dynamic mortars on sliding-mesh interfaces to couple rotating and stationary domains. On the nonconforming sliding-mesh interfaces, the related variables are first projected from cell faces to mortars to compute common fluxes, and then the common fluxes are projected back from the mortars to the cell faces to ensure conservation. To verify the spatial order of accuracy of the sliding-mesh spectral difference (SSD) method, both inviscid and viscous flow cases are tested. It is shown that the SSD method preserves the high-order accuracy of the SD method. Meanwhile, the SSD method is found to be very efficient in terms of computational cost. This novel sliding-mesh interface method is very suitable for parallel processing with domain decomposition. It can be applied to a wide range of problems, such as the hydrodynamics of marine propellers, the aerodynamics of rotorcraft, wind turbines, and oscillating wing power generators, etc.}
