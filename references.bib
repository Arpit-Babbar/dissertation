  abstract      = "Nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws admit singular
                   solutions such as shockwaves (discontinuities in conserved
                   variables), rarefaction waves (discontinuities in
                   derivatives), and vacuum states (loss of strong
                   hyperbolicity). When ostensibly high-order numerical methods
                   are applied in such solution regimes, unphysical
                   oscillations present themselves that can lead to large
                   errors and a breakdown of the numerical simulation. In this
                   work we develop a new Lax-Wendroff discontinuous Galerkin
                   (LxW-DG) method with a limiting strategy that keeps the
                   solution non-oscillatory and positivity-preserving for
                   relevant variables, such as height in the shallow water
                   equations and density and pressure in the compressible Euler
                   equations. The proposed LxW-DG scheme updates the solution
                   over each time-step with a locally-implicit predictor
                   followed by an explicit corrector. The locally-implicit
                   prediction phase is formulated in terms of primitive
                   variables, which greatly simplifies the solver. The
                   resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations are
                   approximately solved via a Picard iteration, where the
                   number of iterations is equal to the order of accuracy of
                   the method. The correction phase is an explicit evaluation
                   formulated in terms of conservative variables in order to
                   guarantee numerical conservation. In order to achieve full
                   positivity-preservation, limiting is required in both the
                   prediction and correction steps. The resulting scheme is
                   applied to several standard test cases for the shallow water
                   and compressible Euler equations. All of the presented
                   examples are written in a freely available open-source

    abstract = "{Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code arepo, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.}",

    abstract = "{Solving the Euler equations of ideal hydrodynamics as accurately and efficiently as possible is a key requirement in many astrophysical simulations. It is therefore important to continuously advance the numerical methods implemented in current astrophysical codes, especially also in light of evolving computer technology, which favours certain computational approaches over others. Here we introduce the new adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code tenet, which employs a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for hydrodynamics. The Euler equations in this method are solved in a weak formulation with a polynomial basis by means of explicit Runge–Kutta time integration and Gauss–Legendre quadrature. This approach offers significant advantages over commonly employed second-order finite-volume (FV) solvers. In particular, the higher order capability renders it computationally more efficient, in the sense that the same precision can be obtained at significantly less computational cost. Also, the DG scheme inherently conserves angular momentum in regions where no limiting takes place, and it typically produces much smaller numerical diffusion and advection errors than an FV approach. A further advantage lies in a more natural handling of AMR refinement boundaries, where a fall-back to first order can be avoided. Finally, DG requires no wide stencils at high order, and offers an improved data locality and a focus on local computations, which is favourable for current and upcoming highly parallel supercomputers. We describe the formulation and implementation details of our new code, and demonstrate its performance and accuracy with a set of two- and three-dimensional test problems. The results confirm that DG schemes have a high potential for astrophysical applications.}",

abstract = {On modern hardware architectures, the performance of Flux Reconstruction (FR) methods can be limited by memory bandwidth. In a typical implementation, these methods are implemented as a chain of distinct kernels. Often, a dataset which has just been written in the main memory by a kernel is read back immediately by the next kernel. One way to avoid such a redundant expenditure of memory bandwidth is kernel fusion. However, on a practical level kernel fusion requires that the source for all kernels be available, thus preventing calls to certain third-party library functions. Moreover, it can add substantial complexity to a codebase. An alternative to full kernel fusion is cache blocking. But for this to be effective, CPU cache has to be meaningfully big. Historically, size of L1 and L2 caches prevented cache blocking for high-order CFD applications. However in recent years, size of L2 cache has grown from around 0.25 MiB to 1.25 MiB, and made it possible to apply cache blocking for high-order CFD codes. In this approach, kernels remain distinct, and are executed one after another on small chunks of data that can fit in the cache, as opposed to on full datasets. These chunks of data stay in the cache and whenever a kernel requests access to data that is already in the cache, memory bandwidth is conserved. In this study, a data structure that facilitates cache blocking is considered, and a range of kernel grouping configurations for an FR based Euler solver are examined. A theoretical study is conducted for hexahedral elements with no anti-aliasing at p=3 and p=4 in order to determine the predicted performance of a few kernel grouping configurations. Then, these candidates are implemented in the PyFR solver and the performance gains in practice are compared with the theoretical estimates that range between 2.05x and 2.50x. An inviscid Taylor-Green Vortex test case is used as a benchmark, and the most performant configuration leads to a speedup of approximately 2.81x in practice.}

The method is of collocation type, is quadrature free and can be cast in terms of matrix and vector operations. Special attention is paid to the construction of numerical flux, including for non-linear problems, resulting in higher CFL numbers than existing methods, which is shown through Fourier analysis and yielding uniform performance at all orders. Numerical results up to fifth order of accuracy for linear and non-linear problems are given to demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the method.}

We extend a discontinuous finite element discretization originally considered for hyperbolic systems such as the Euler equations to the case of the Navier–Stokes equations by treating the viscous terms with a mixed formulation. The method combines two key ideas which are at the basis of the finite volume and of the finite element method, the physics of wave propagation being accounted for by means of Riemann problems and accuracy being obtained by means of high-order polynomial approximations within elements. As a consequence the method is ideally suited to compute high-order accurate solution of the Navier–Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by computing the compressible viscous flow on a flat plate and around a NACA0012 airfoil for several flow regimes using constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.}

We first show that the metric terms can be written in three forms: the usual cross product and two curl forms. The first curl form is identical to the ``conservative'' form presented by Thomas and Lombard [(1979), AIAA J. 17(10), 1030--1037]. The second is a coordinate invariant form. We prove that in two space dimensions, the typical approximation of the cross product form does satisfy a discrete set of metric identities if the boundaries are isoparametric and the quadrature is sufficiently precise. We show that in three dimensions, this cross product form does not satisfy the metric identities, except in exceptional circumstances. Finally, we present approximations of the curl forms of the metric terms that satisfy the discrete metric identities. Two examples are presented to illustrate how the evaluation of the metric terms affects the satisfaction of the discrete metric identities, one in two space dimensions and the other in three.}

abstract = {We present a new multidomain spectral collocation method that uses a staggered grid for the solution of compressible flow problems. The solution unknowns are defined at the nodes of a Gauss quadrature rule. The fluxes are evaluated at the nodes of a Gauss–Lobatto rule. The method is conservative, free-stream preserving, and exponentially accurate. A significant advantage of the method is that subdomain corners are not included in the approximation, making solutions in complex geometries easier to compute.}

abstract = {An adaptive finite element scheme for transient problems is presented. The classic h-enrichment / coarsening is employed in conjunction with a triangular finite element discretization in two dimensions. A mesh change is performed every n timesteps, depending on the Courant number employed and the number of ‘protective layers’ added ahead of the refined region. In order to simplify the refinement/ coarsening logic and to be as fast as possible, only one level of refinement/coarsening is allowed per mesh change. A high degree of vectorizability has been achieved on the CRAY XMP 12 at NRL. Several examples involving shock-shock interactions and the impact of shocks on structures demonstrate the performance of the method, indicating that considerable savings in CPU time and storage can be realized even for strongly unsteady flows.}

Based on the unstructured hp-adaptive SSDC framework of entropy conservative or dissipative semidiscretizations using summation-by-parts and simultaneous-approximation-term operators, we develop the first discretizations for compressible computational fluid dynamics that are primary conservative, locally entropy stable in the fully discrete sense under a usual CFL condition, explicit except for the parallelizable solution of a single scalar equation per element, and arbitrarily high-order accurate in space and time. We demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of the fully-discrete explicit locally entropy-stable solver for a set of test cases of increasing complexity.}

ABSTRACT = {In this article we use the new, unified framework of high order one-step <i>P<sub>N</sub>P<sub>M</sub></i> schemes recently proposed for inviscid hyperbolic conservation laws by Dumbser, Balsara, Toro, and Munz (2008) in order to solve the viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations in two and three space dimensions on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes. The <i>P<sub>N</sub>P<sub>M</sub></i> framework uses piecewise polynomials of degree <i>N</i> to represent data in each cell and piecewise polynomials of degree <i>M ≥ N</i> to compute the fluxes and source terms. This new general machinery contains usual high order finite volume schemes (<i>N</i> = 0) and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods (<i>N = M</i>) just as special cases of a more general unified class of numerical methods. The new time discretization approach used in our schemes is of the one-step type and is obtained by a local space-time Galerkin predictor-corrector method, where in the predictor step a local weak form of the governing PDE is solved in the small. The formal order of accuracy of our one-step time discretization automatically matches the spatial discretization order.<br/>
We perform a numerical convergence study for an unsteady test case on unstructured meshes with <i>P<sub>N</sub>P<sub>M</sub></i> methods from third to <i>eighth order of accuracy in space and time</i> and show detailed CPU times to allow the reader a critical performance assessment. We present numerical results for the viscous Orszag-Tang vortex system, for the first problem of Stokes and for a steady laminar boundary layer at high Reynolds number. We furthermore compute the unsteady flow past a circular cylinder and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in two and three space dimensions.},

Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics. The same framework also applies to high order accurate finite volume (e.g. essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) or weighted ENO (WENO)) schemes. Motivated by Perthame and Shu (1996) [20] and Zhang and Shu (2010) [26], a general framework, for arbitrary order of accuracy, is established to construct a positivity preserving limiter for the finite volume and DG methods with first order Euler forward time discretization solving one-dimensional compressible Euler equations. The limiter can be proven to maintain high order accuracy and is easy to implement. Strong stability preserving (SSP) high order time discretizations will keep the positivity property. Following the idea in Zhang and Shu (2010) [26], we extend this framework to higher dimensions on rectangular meshes in a straightforward way. Numerical tests for the third order DG method are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods.}

The comparisons were drawn through studies of a one-dimensional reflected shock wave, a flat-faced step in supersonic flow, and passage of a normal shock wave over a stationary cone.

abstract = {The first paper of this series presents a discretely entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations on three-dimensional curvilinear unstructured hexahedral meshes. Compared to other fluid dynamics systems such as the shallow water equations or the compressible Navier–Stokes equations, the resistive MHD equations need special considerations because of the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. For instance, it is well known that for the symmetrization of the ideal MHD system as well as the continuous entropy analysis a non-conservative term proportional to the divergence of the magnetic field, typically referred to as the Powell term, must be included. As a consequence, the mimicry of the continuous entropy analysis in the discrete sense demands a suitable DG approximation of the non-conservative terms in addition to the ideal MHD terms. This paper focuses on the resistive MHD equations: Our first contribution is a proof that the resistive terms are symmetric and positive-definite when formulated in entropy space as gradients of the entropy variables, which enables us to show that the entropy inequality holds for the resistive MHD equations. This continuous analysis is the key for our DG discretization and guides the path for the construction of an approximation that discretely mimics the entropy inequality, typically termed entropy stability. Our second contribution is a detailed derivation and analysis of the discretization on three-dimensional curvilinear meshes. The discrete analysis relies on the summation-by-parts property, which is satisfied by the DG spectral element method (DGSEM) with Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto (LGL) nodes. Although the divergence-free constraint is included in the non-conservative terms, the resulting method has no particular treatment of the magnetic field divergence errors, which might pollute the solution quality. Our final contribution is the extension of the standard resistive MHD equations and our DG approximation with a divergence cleaning mechanism that is based on a generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM). As a conclusion to the first part of this series, we provide detailed numerical validations of our DGSEM method that underline our theoretical derivations. In addition, we show a numerical example where the entropy stable DGSEM demonstrates increased robustness compared to the standard DGSEM.}

abstract = {Since proposed in Zhang and Shu (2010) [1], the Zhang–Shu framework has attracted extensive attention and motivated many bound-preserving (BP) high-order discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume schemes for various hyperbolic equations. A key ingredient in the framework is the decomposition of the cell averages of the numerical solution into a convex combination of the solution values at certain quadrature points, which helps to rewrite high-order schemes as convex combinations of formally first-order schemes. The classic convex decomposition originally proposed by Zhang and Shu has been widely used over the past decade. It was verified, only for the 1D quadratic and cubic polynomial spaces, that the classic decomposition is optimal in the sense of achieving the mildest BP CFL condition. Yet, it remained unclear whether the classic decomposition is optimal in multiple dimensions. In this paper, we find that the classic multidimensional decomposition based on the tensor product of Gauss–Lobatto and Gauss quadratures is generally not optimal, and we discover a novel alternative decomposition for the 2D and 3D polynomial spaces of total degree up to 2 and 3, respectively, on Cartesian meshes. Our new decomposition allows a larger BP time step-size than the classic one, and moreover, it is rigorously proved to be optimal to attain the mildest BP CFL condition, yet requires much fewer nodes. The discovery of such an optimal convex decomposition is highly nontrivial yet meaningful, as it may lead to an improvement of high-order BP schemes for a large class of hyperbolic or convection-dominated equations, at the cost of only a slight and local modification to the implementation code. Several numerical examples are provided to further validate the advantages of using our optimal decomposition over the classic one in terms of efficiency.}

This is achieved by making use of the individual contributions of the local spatial discretisation error and the local time integration error to the global error in the numerical solution. Numerical results are used to illustrate the performance of this strategy. }

abstract = {Summary Time integration of Fourier pseudospectral DNS is usually performed using the classical fourth-order accurate Runge-Kutta method or other second- or third-order methods, with a fixed step size. We investigate the use of higher-order Runge-Kutta pairs and automatic step size control based on local error estimation. We find that the fifth-order accurate Runge-Kutta pair of Bogacki and Shampine gives much greater accuracy at a significantly reduced computational cost. Specifically, we demonstrate speedups of 2× to 10× for the same accuracy. Numerical tests (including the Taylor-Green vortex, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and homogeneous isotropic turbulence) confirm the reliability and efficiency of the method. We also show that adaptive time stepping provides a significant computational advantage for some problems (like the development of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability) without compromising accuracy.},

abstract="The aim of adaptive methods for time-dependent p.d.e.s is to control the numerical error so that it is less than a user-specified tolerance. This error depends on the spatial discretization method, the spatial mesh, the method of time integration and the timestep. The spatial discretization method and positioning of the spatial mesh points should attempt to ensure that the spatial error is controlled to meet the user's requirements. It is then desirable to integrate the o.d.e. system in time with sufficient accuracy so that the temporal error does not corrupt the spatial accuracy or the reliability of the spatial error estimates. This paper is concerned with the development of a prototype algorithm of this type, based on a cell-centered triangular finite volume scheme, for two space dimensional convection-dominated problems.",

abstract = {The second paper of this series presents two robust entropy stable shock-capturing methods for discontinuous Galerkin spectral element (DGSEM) discretizations of the compressible magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) equations. Specifically, we use the resistive GLM-MHD equations, which include a divergence cleaning mechanism that is based on a generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM). For the continuous entropy analysis to hold, and due to the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field, the GLM-MHD system requires the use of non-conservative terms, which need special treatment. Hennemann et al. (2020) [25] recently presented an entropy stable shock-capturing strategy for DGSEM discretizations of the Euler equations that blends the DGSEM scheme with a subcell first-order finite volume (FV) method. Our first contribution is the extension of the method of Hennemann et al. to systems with non-conservative terms, such as the GLM-MHD equations. In our approach, the advective and non-conservative terms of the equations are discretized with a hybrid FV/DGSEM scheme, whereas the visco-resistive terms are discretized only with the high-order DGSEM method. We prove that the extended method is semi-discretely entropy stable on three-dimensional unstructured curvilinear meshes. Our second contribution is the derivation and analysis of a second entropy stable shock-capturing method that provides enhanced resolution by using a subcell reconstruction procedure that is carefully built to ensure entropy stability. We provide a numerical verification of the properties of the hybrid FV/DGSEM schemes on curvilinear meshes and show their robustness and accuracy with common benchmark cases, such as the Orszag-Tang vortex and the GEM (Geospace Environmental Modeling) reconnection challenge. Finally, we simulate a space physics application: the interaction of Jupiter's magnetic field with the plasma torus generated by the moon Io.}

Utilizing a flux reconstruction formulation, it has been proved (for one-dimensional linear advection) that the spectral difference method is stable for all orders of accuracy in a norm of Sobolev type, provided that the interior flux collocation points are located at zeros of the corresponding Legendre polynomials. In this article the aforementioned result is extended in order to develop a new class of one-dimensional energy stable flux reconstruction schemes. The energy stable schemes are parameterized by a single scalar quantity, which if chosen judiciously leads to the recovery of various well known high-order methods (including a particular nodal discontinuous Galerkin method and a particular spectral difference method). The analysis offers significant insight into why certain flux reconstruction schemes are stable, whereas others are not. Also, from a practical standpoint, the analysis provides a simple prescription for implementing an infinite range of energy stable high-order methods via the intuitive flux reconstruction approach.},

abstract = {Provably stable flux reconstruction (FR) schemes are derived for partial differential equations cast in curvilinear coordinates. Specifically, energy stable flux reconstruction (ESFR) schemes are considered as they allow for design flexibility as well as stability proofs for the linear advection problem on affine elements. Additionally, the curvilinear metric split-form for a linear physical flux is examined as it enables the development of energy stability proofs. The first critical step proves, that in curvilinear coordinates, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) conservative and non-conservative forms are inherently different–even under exact integration and analytically exact metric terms. This analysis demonstrates that the split form is essential to developing provably stable DG schemes on curvilinear coordinates and motivates the construction of metric dependent ESFR correction functions in each element. Furthermore, the provably stable FR schemes differ from schemes in the literature that only apply the ESFR correction functions to surface terms or on the conservative form, and instead incorporate the ESFR correction functions on the full split form of the equations. It is demonstrated that the scheme is divergent when the correction functions are only used for surface reconstruction in curvilinear coordinates. We numerically verify the stability claims for our proposed FR split forms and compare them to ESFR schemes in the literature. Lastly, the newly proposed provably stable FR schemes are shown to obtain optimal orders of convergence. The scheme loses the orders of accuracy at the equivalent correction parameter value c as that of the one-dimensional ESFR scheme.}

A freestream preservation test is conducted, and the symmetric conservative metric constructed by the appropriate procedure preserves the freestream regardless of the order of shape functions, while other metrics cannot always preserve the freestream. Also a convecting vortex is computed on three-dimensional wavy grids, and the formal order of accuracy is achieved when the symmetric conservative metric is appropriately constructed, while it is not when they are inappropriately constructed. In addition, although the sufficient condition for the freestream preservation with the nonconservative (cross product form) metric was reported in the previous study to be that the order of solution polynomial has to be greater than or equal to the twice of the order of a shape function, a special case is newly found in the present study: when the Radau polynomial is used for the correction function, the freestream is preserved even if the solution order is lower than the known condition. Using the properties of Legendre polynomials, the mechanism for this special case is analytically explained, considering the cancellation of aliasing errors.}

The method is a collocation form of the discontinuous Galerkin method for hyperbolic systems where the solution is approximated by a tensor product Legendre expansion and inner products are replaced with Gauss–Legendre quadratures. To increase flexibility of the method, we use a mortar element method to couple element faces. Mortars provide a means for coupling element faces along which the polynomial orders differ, which allows the flexibility to choose the approximation order within an element by considering only local resolution requirements. Mortars also permit local subdivision of a mesh by connecting element faces that do not share a full side. We present evidence showing that the convergence of the non-conforming approximations is spectral along with examples of their use. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Troubled cell values are discarded and re-computed starting again from the previous time-step using a more dissipative scheme but only locally, close to these cells. By locally decrementing the degree of the polynomial reconstructions from 2 to 0 we switch from a third-order to a first-order accurate but more stable scheme. The entropy indicator sensor is used to refine/coarsen the mesh. This sensor is also employed in an a posteriori manner because if some refinement is needed at the end of a time step, then the current time-step is recomputed with the refined mesh, but only locally, close to the new cells. We show on a large set of numerical tests that this a posteriori limiting procedure coupled with the entropy-based AMR technology can maintain not only optimal accuracy on smooth flows but also stability on discontinuous profiles such as shock waves, contacts, interfaces, etc. Moreover numerical evidences show that this approach is at least comparable in terms of accuracy and cost to a more classical CWENO approach within the same AMR context.}

abstract = {An adaptive method based on the idea of multiple component grids for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations using finite difference techniques is presented. Based upon Richardson-type estimates of the truncation error, refined grids are created or existing ones removed to attain a given accuracy for a minimum amount of work. The approach is recursive in that fine grids can contain even finer grids. The grids with finer mesh width in space also have a smaller mesh width in time, making this a mesh refinement algorithm in time and space. We present the algorithm, error estimation procedure, and the data structures, and conclude with numerical examples in one and two space dimensions.}

abstract = {The aim of this work is the development of an automatic, adaptive mesh refinement strategy for solving hyperbolic conservation laws in two dimensions. There are two main difficulties in doing this. The first problem is due to the presence of discontinuities in the solution and the effect on them of discontinuities in the mesh. The second problem is how to organize the algorithm to minimize memory and CPU overhead. This is an important consideration and will continue to be important as more sophisticated algorithms that use data structures other than arrays are developed for use on vector and parallel computers.}

abstract = {The flux reconstruction (FR) method has gained popularity in the research community as it recovers promising high-order methods through modally filtered correction fields, such as the discontinuous Galerkin method, amongst others, on unstructured grids over complex geometries. Moreover, FR schemes, specifically energy stable FR (ESFR) schemes also known as Vincent-Castonguay-Jameson-Huynh schemes, have proven attractive as they allow for design flexibility as well as stability proofs for the linear advection problem on affine elements. Additionally, split forms have recently seen a resurgence in research activity due to their resultant nonlinear (entropy) stability proofs. This paper derives for the first time nonlinearly stable ESFR schemes in split form that enable nonlinear stability proofs for, uncollocated, modal, ESFR split forms with different volume and surface cubature nodes. The critical enabling technology is applying the splitting to the discrete stiffness operator. This naturally leads to appropriate surface and numerical fluxes, enabling both entropy stability and conservation proofs. When these schemes are recast in strong form, they differ from schemes found in the ESFR literature as the ESFR correction functions are incorporated on the volume integral. Furthermore, numerical experiments are conducted for Burgers' equation verifying that the new class of proposed ESFR split forms is nonlinearly stable in contrast to the standard split form ESFR approach. Lastly, the new ESFR split form is shown to obtain the correct orders of accuracy.}

The novelty in the algorithm is that it stops when a guaranteed upper bound for the maximum speed is reached with a prescribed accuracy. The convergence rate of the algorithm is cubic and the bound is guaranteed for gasses with the co-volume equation of state and the heat capacity ratio γ in the range ( 1 , 5 / 3 .},

We also present new ways of obtaining wave-speed estimates. The resulting solver is as accurate and robust as the exact Riemann solver, but it is simpler and computationally more efficient than the latter, particulaly for non-ideal gases. The improved Riemann solver is implemented in the second-order WAF method and tested for one-dimensional problems with exact solutions and for a two-dimensional problem with experimental results.},

abstract = {The main result in this paper is a provably entropy stable shock capturing approach for the high order entropy stable Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM) based on a hybrid blending with a subcell low order variant. Since it is possible to rewrite a high order summation-by-parts (SBP) operator into an equivalent conservative finite volume form, we were able to design a low order scheme directly with the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes that is compatible to the discrete entropy analysis used for the proof of the entropy stable DGSEM. Furthermore, we present a hybrid low order/high order discretisation where it is possible to seamlessly blend between the two approaches, while still being provably entropy stable. With tensor products and careful design of the low order scheme on curved elements, we are able to extend the approach to three spatial dimensions on unstructured curvilinear hexahedral meshes. We validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate convergence order for smooth problems, conservation of the primary quantities and discrete entropy stability for an arbitrary blending on curvilinear grids. In practical simulations, we connect the blending factor to a local troubled element indicator that provides the control of the amount of low order dissipation injected into the high order scheme. We modified an existing shock indicator, which is based on the modal polynomial representation, to our provably stable hybrid scheme. The aim is to reduce the impact of the parameters as good as possible. We describe our indicator in detail and demonstrate its robustness in combination with the hybrid scheme, as it is possible to compute all the different test cases without changing the indicator. The test cases include e.g. the double Mach reflection setup, forward and backward facing steps with shock Mach numbers up to 100. The proposed approach is relatively straight forward to implement in an existing entropy stable DGSEM code as only modifications local to an element are necessary.}

abstract = {An approach to numerical convection is presented that exclusively yields upstream-centered schemes. It starts from a meshwise approximation of the initial-value distribution by simple basic functions, e.g., Legendre polynomials. In every mesh the integral of the distribution is conserved. The overall approximation need not be continuous. The approximate distribution is convected explicitly and then remapped meshwise in terms of the basic functions. The weights of the basic functions that approximate the initial values in a mesh may be determined by finite differencing, but the most accurate schemes are obtained by least-squares fitting. In the latter schemes, the weights of the basic functions must be regarded as independent state quantities and must be stored separately. Examples of second-order and third-order schemes are given, and the accuracy of these schemes is discussed. Several monotonicity algorithms, designed to prevent numerical oscillations, are indicated. Numerical examples are given of linear and nonlinear wave propagation, also regarding monotonicity.}

The essential feature of this method is that a lower dimensional grid is fitted to and follows the discontinuous waves. At the intersection points of these discontinuities, two-dimensional Riemann problems occur. In this paper we study such two-dimensional Riemann problems from both numerical and theoretical points of view. Specifically included is a numerical solution for the Mach reflection, a general classification scheme for two-dimensional elementary waves, and a discussion of problems and conjectures in this area.}

    abstract = "{Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code arepo, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.}",

By adapting the filter strength to enforce positivity and a local discrete minimum entropy principle, the resulting approach can robustly resolve strong discontinuities with sub-element resolution, does not require problem-dependent parameter tuning, and can be easily implemented on general unstructured meshes with relatively low computational cost. The efficacy of the approach is shown in numerical experiments on hyperbolic and mixed hyperbolic-parabolic conservation laws such as the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for problems including extreme shocks, shock-vortex interactions, and complex compressible turbulent flows.}

    abstract = { In this paper, we propose a novel discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to control the spurious oscillations when solving the scalar hyperbolic conservation laws. Usually, the high order linear numerical schemes would generate spurious oscillations when the solution of the hyperbolic conservation laws contains discontinuities. The spurious oscillations may be harmful to the numerical simulation, as it not only generates some artificial structures not belonging to the problems, but also causes many overshoots and undershoots that make the numerical scheme less robust. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper we introduce a numerical damping term to control spurious oscillations based on the classic DG formulation. In comparison to the classic DG method, the proposed DG method still maintains many good properties, such as the extremely local data structure, conservation, \$L^2\$-boundedness, optimal error estimates, and superconvergence. We also provide some numerical examples to show the good performance of the proposed DG scheme and verify our theoretical results. }

abstract = {We present a general family of subcell limiting strategies to construct robust high-order accurate nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes. The main strategy is to construct compatible low order finite volume (FV) type discretizations that allow for convex blending with the high-order variant with the goal of guaranteeing additional properties, such as bounds on physical quantities and/or guaranteed entropy dissipation. For an implementation of this main strategy, four main ingredients are identified that may be combined in a flexible manner: (i) a nodal high-order DG method on Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto nodes, (ii) a compatible robust subcell FV scheme, (iii) a convex combination strategy for the two schemes, which can be element-wise or subcell-wise, and (iv) a strategy to compute the convex blending factors, which can be either based on heuristic troubled-cell indicators, or using ideas from flux-corrected transport methods. By carefully designing the metric terms of the subcell FV method, the resulting methods can be used on unstructured curvilinear meshes, are locally conservative, can handle strong shocks efficiently while directly guaranteeing physical bounds on quantities such as density, pressure or entropy. We further show that it is possible to choose the four ingredients to recover existing methods such as a provably entropy dissipative subcell shock-capturing approach or a sparse invariant domain preserving approach. We test the versatility of the presented strategies and mix and match the four ingredients to solve challenging simulation setups, such as the KPP problem (a hyperbolic conservation law with non-convex flux function), turbulent and hypersonic Euler simulations, and MHD problems featuring shocks and turbulence.}

These methods are based on a subcell flux corrected transport (FCT) methodology that involves blending a high-order target scheme with a robust, low-order invariant domain preserving method that is obtained using a graph viscosity technique. The new low-order discretizations are based on sparse stencils which do not increase with the polynomial degree of the high-order DG method. As a result, the accuracy of the low-order method does not degrade when used with high-order target methods. The method is applied to both scalar conservation laws, for which the discrete maximum principle is naturally enforced, and to systems of conservation laws such as the Euler equations, for which positivity of density and a minimum principle for specific entropy are enforced. Numerical results are presented on a number of benchmark test cases.}

abstract = {SUMMARYWith high-order methods becoming more widely adopted throughout the field of computational fluid dynamics, the development of new computationally efficient algorithms has increased tremendously in recent years. One of the most recent methods to be developed is the flux reconstruction approach, which allows various well-known high-order schemes to be cast within a single unifying framework. Whilst a connection between flux reconstruction and the more widely adopted discontinuous Galerkin method has been established elsewhere, it still remains to fully investigate the explicit connections between the many popular variants of the discontinuous Galerkin method and the flux reconstruction approach. In this work, we closely examine the connections between three nodal versions of tensor-product discontinuous Galerkin spectral element approximations and two types of flux reconstruction schemes for solving systems of conservation laws on quadrilateral meshes. The different types of discontinuous Galerkin approximations arise from the choice of the solution nodes of the Lagrange basis representing the solution and from the quadrature approximation used to integrate the mass matrix and the other terms of the discretization. By considering both linear and nonlinear advection equations on a regular grid, we examine the mathematical properties that connect these discretizations. These arguments are further confirmed by the results of an empirical numerical study. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Different from the classical Runge--Kutta (R--K) temporal discretization for first order Riemann solvers as building blocks, the current approach is solely associated with Lax--Wendroff (L--W) type schemes as the building blocks. As a result, a two-stage procedure can be constructed to achieve a fourth order temporal accuracy, rather than using the well-developed four-stage procedure for R--K methods. The generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver is taken as a representative of L--W type schemes for the construction of a two-stage fourth order scheme. }

These fluxes are then used in the entropy stable DG framework of [1] to obtain entropy stability of the semi-discrete schemes. We also extend these schemes to a source term that models plasma laser interaction. For the time discretization, we use strong stability preserving methods. The proposed schemes are then tested on several test cases to demonstrate stability, accuracy and robustness.}

The divergence-free character of the magnetic field is instead taken into account through the so-called ‘divergence-cleaning’ approach. The convergence of the new scheme is verified up to the fifth order in space and time and the results for a set of significant numerical tests including shock tube problems, the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) rotor and blast wave problems, as well as the Orszag–Tang vortex system are shown. We also consider a simple case of the relativistic Kelvin–Helmholtz instability with a magnetic field, emphasizing the potential of the new method for studying turbulent RMHD flows. We discuss the advantages of our new approach when the equations of relativistic MHD need to be solved with high accuracy within various astrophysical systems.}",

The optimization of the new time integration schemes is based on the spectrum of the discrete spatial operator for the advection equation. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new schemes compared to some widely used classic explicit Runge--Kutta methods, we report the wall-clock time versus the error for the simulation of the two-dimensional advection equation and the propagation of an isentropic vortex with the compressible Euler equations. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed optimized schemes for more complex flow problems are presented for the three-dimensional Taylor–Green vortex at a Reynolds number of \$\mathrm{Re} = 1.6 \times 10^3\$ and Mach number \$\mathrm{Ma} = 0.1\$, and the flow past two identical spheres in tandem at a Reynolds number of \$\mathrm{Re} = 3.9 \times 10^3\$ and Mach number \$\mathrm{Ma} = 0.1\$. }

abstract = {High-order numerical methods for unstructured grids combine the superior accuracy of high-order spectral or finite difference methods with the geometric flexibility of low-order finite volume or finite element schemes. The Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach unifies various high-order schemes for unstructured grids within a single framework. Additionally, the FR approach exhibits a significant degree of element locality, and is thus able to run efficiently on modern streaming architectures, such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The aforementioned properties of FR mean it offers a promising route to performing affordable, and hence industrially relevant, scale-resolving simulations of hitherto intractable unsteady flows within the vicinity of real-world engineering geometries. In this paper we present PyFR, an open-source Python based framework for solving advection–diffusion type problems on streaming architectures using the FR approach. The framework is designed to solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids containing various element types. It is also designed to target a range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific language based on the Mako templating engine. The current release of PyFR is able to solve the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on grids of quadrilateral and triangular elements in two dimensions, and hexahedral elements in three dimensions, targeting clusters of CPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs. Results are presented for various benchmark flow problems, single-node performance is discussed, and scalability of the code is demonstrated on up to 104 NVIDIA M2090 GPUs.

abstract = {This paper presents an arbitrary high-order accurate ADER Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method on space–time adaptive meshes (AMR) for the solution of two important families of non-linear time dependent partial differential equations for compressible dissipative flows : the compressible Navier–Stokes equations and the equations of viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics in two and three space-dimensions. The work continues a recent series of papers concerning the development and application of a proper a posteriori subcell finite volume limiting procedure suitable for discontinuous Galerkin methods (Dumbser et al., 2014, Zanotti et al., 2015 [40,41]). It is a well known fact that a major weakness of high order DG methods lies in the difficulty of limiting discontinuous solutions, which generate spurious oscillations, namely the so-called ‘Gibbs phenomenon’. In the present work, a nonlinear stabilization of the scheme is sequentially and locally introduced only for troubled cells on the basis of a novel a posteriori detection criterion, i.e. the MOOD approach. The main benefits of the MOOD paradigm, i.e. the computational robustness even in the presence of strong shocks, are preserved and the numerical diffusion is considerably reduced also for the limited cells by resorting to a proper sub-grid. In practice the method first produces a so-called candidate solution by using a high order accurate unlimited DG scheme. Then, a set of numerical and physical detection criteria is applied to the candidate solution, namely: positivity of pressure and density, absence of floating point errors and satisfaction of a discrete maximum principle in the sense of polynomials. Furthermore, in those cells where at least one of these criteria is violated the computed candidate solution is detected as troubled and is locally rejected. Subsequently, a more reliable numerical solution is recomputed a posteriori by employing a more robust but still very accurate ADER-WENO finite volume scheme on the subgrid averages within that troubled cell. Finally, a high order DG polynomial is reconstructed back from the evolved subcell averages. We apply the whole approach for the first time to the equations of compressible gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in the presence of viscosity, thermal conductivity and magnetic resistivity, therefore extending our family of adaptive ADER-DG schemes to cases for which the numerical fluxes also depend on the gradient of the state vector. The distinguished high-resolution properties of the presented numerical scheme standout against a wide number of non-trivial test cases both for the compressible Navier–Stokes and the viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations. The present results show clearly that the shock-capturing capability of the news schemes is significantly enhanced within a cell-by-cell Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) implementation together with time accurate local time stepping (LTS).}

We extend a discontinuous finite element discretization originally considered for hyperbolic systems such as the Euler equations to the case of the Navier–Stokes equations by treating the viscous terms with a mixed formulation. The method combines two key ideas which are at the basis of the finite volume and of the finite element method, the physics of wave propagation being accounted for by means of Riemann problems and accuracy being obtained by means of high-order polynomial approximations within elements. As a consequence the method is ideally suited to compute high-order accurate solution of the Navier–Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by computing the compressible viscous flow on a flat plate and around a NACA0012 airfoil for several flow regimes using constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.}
