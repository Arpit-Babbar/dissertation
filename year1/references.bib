abstract = {The main result in this paper is a provably entropy stable shock capturing approach for the high order entropy stable Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM) based on a hybrid blending with a subcell low order variant. Since it is possible to rewrite a high order summation-by-parts (SBP) operator into an equivalent conservative finite volume form, we were able to design a low order scheme directly with the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes that is compatible to the discrete entropy analysis used for the proof of the entropy stable DGSEM. Furthermore, we present a hybrid low order/high order discretisation where it is possible to seamlessly blend between the two approaches, while still being provably entropy stable. With tensor products and careful design of the low order scheme on curved elements, we are able to extend the approach to three spatial dimensions on unstructured curvilinear hexahedral meshes. We validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate convergence order for smooth problems, conservation of the primary quantities and discrete entropy stability for an arbitrary blending on curvilinear grids. In practical simulations, we connect the blending factor to a local troubled element indicator that provides the control of the amount of low order dissipation injected into the high order scheme. We modified an existing shock indicator, which is based on the modal polynomial representation, to our provably stable hybrid scheme. The aim is to reduce the impact of the parameters as good as possible. We describe our indicator in detail and demonstrate its robustness in combination with the hybrid scheme, as it is possible to compute all the different test cases without changing the indicator. The test cases include e.g. the double Mach reflection setup, forward and backward facing steps with shock Mach numbers up to 100. The proposed approach is relatively straight forward to implement in an existing entropy stable DGSEM code as only modifications local to an element are necessary.}

  title         = "A positivity-preserving limiting strategy for
                   locally-implicit {Lax-Wendroff} discontinuous Galerkin
                   methods",

  abstract      = "Nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws admit singular
                   solutions such as shockwaves (discontinuities in conserved
                   variables), rarefaction waves (discontinuities in
                   derivatives), and vacuum states (loss of strong
                   hyperbolicity). When ostensibly high-order numerical methods
                   are applied in such solution regimes, unphysical
                   oscillations present themselves that can lead to large
                   errors and a breakdown of the numerical simulation. In this
                   work we develop a new Lax-Wendroff discontinuous Galerkin
                   (LxW-DG) method with a limiting strategy that keeps the
                   solution non-oscillatory and positivity-preserving for
                   relevant variables, such as height in the shallow water
                   equations and density and pressure in the compressible Euler
                   equations. The proposed LxW-DG scheme updates the solution
                   over each time-step with a locally-implicit predictor
                   followed by an explicit corrector. The locally-implicit
                   prediction phase is formulated in terms of primitive
                   variables, which greatly simplifies the solver. The
                   resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations are
                   approximately solved via a Picard iteration, where the
                   number of iterations is equal to the order of accuracy of
                   the method. The correction phase is an explicit evaluation
                   formulated in terms of conservative variables in order to
                   guarantee numerical conservation. In order to achieve full
                   positivity-preservation, limiting is required in both the
                   prediction and correction steps. The resulting scheme is
                   applied to several standard test cases for the shallow water
                   and compressible Euler equations. All of the presented
                   examples are written in a freely available open-source
                   Python code.",
